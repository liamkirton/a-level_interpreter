Overview:
=========

This was my A-Level (UK) Computing project, developed in early 2001.

The idea was to implement a basic interpreter for a custom language, and the
interpreter was designed to demonstrate (to a novice) how such an interpreted
language might be executed.

Usage:
======

Run Interpreter.exe, click "Load", navigate to "Programs" and select one of the
".lan" files.

Click "Step" repeatedly to walk through execution of the program.
